# Graphing-Calculator

This is one of my projects in the way to achieve "College Algebra with Python" certification at freeCodeCamp.org. It was designed using Python.

Projectile Game
Learn quadratic functions by building a projectile game. Starting at (0,0) you launch a toy rocket that must clear a wall. You can randomize the height and location of the wall. The goal is to determine what initial velocity would get the rocket over the wall. Bonus: make an animation of the path of the rocket.

Dephine Graphing Functions
Building on what you have already done, create a menu with the following options:

Display the graph and a table of values for any "y=" equation input
Solve a system of two equations without graphing
Graph two equations and plot the point of intersection
Given a, b and c in a quadratic equation, plot the roots and vertex
Then think about how you will define a function for each item.

Graphing Calculator
Build a graphing calculator that performs the functions mentioned in the previous step:

Display the graph and a table of values for any "y=" equation input
Solve a system of two equations without graphing
Graph two equations and plot the point of intersection
Given a, b and c in a quadratic equation, plot the roots and vertex
Define each of the functions, and make each option call a function.
